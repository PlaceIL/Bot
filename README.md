## Bot Drawbacks
 
When the bot places a pixel, it may still seem like you can place a pixel even though the bot has already done it for you (so you are in a 5-minute cooldown). The bot currently does not consider the ongoing cooldown, so it assumes that when you open r/place, it can immediately place a pixel. In the worst case, your first pixel may be placed in the next cycle after 4 minutes and 59 seconds.
 
 
 
## Getting token
 
### Using Tampermonkey:  
**Works only if you have 2FA Turned off.**
Click on [this link](./tampermonkey/print_token.user.js?raw=1), and Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the user script. Click on Install. Now, go back to r/place and refresh the page. After a while, an alert with your TOKEN should appear; copy and save it somewhere.

### Using dev-tools ion browser:  
In the browser, open the developer tools, switch to the network tab, reload r/place, and in the request to /r/place, find "accessToken":<token> in the response. Copy the token and use it as a parameter in the headless bot.
